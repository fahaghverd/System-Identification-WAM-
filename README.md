# Dynamic System Identification for 7-DoF WAM Barrett arm 
Model-based control systems are among
most efficient and reliable robotic control systems.
However, extracting manipulatorâ€™s dynamic modelling is
challenging. In this course project, a one-layer MLP
neural network is used to model the lumped function
H, which allows for estimation of joint torques based on
current joint states. The model is investigated using RMSE
and NRMSE metrices. It, also, is further investigated
by comparing the performance with MATLAB MLP and
RBF modellings that we previously discussed in the course.
Compare to them, the model shows good results. However,
generally speaking the model performance does not seam
trustable for control implementation, and there is a need
for upgrading and improving model performance before
implementation.
